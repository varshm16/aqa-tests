# AQA jcstress runner

This playlist runs by default all jcstress tests in minimal `time budget`.  Currently  it is just `-tb 1h` which is trying to squeeze all 11543 tests from jcstress-20240222 to 1hour.  That is not going to work, but the suite should try to squeeze itself to absolute minimum. Another switch which can minimize runtime is `-c` - number of cores to use, although it was not recommended by upstream, ve default to 2.

Other targets are generated subgroups to run targeted groups of tests in case that the affected area could do cause an issue.  Dont forget you have to prefix such target by `disabled...` keyword. All those targets are run with all cores and no forced time budget. 

Both main tests and generated subgroups can take `$JC_TIME_BUDGET` variable to set the time budget and `$JC_CORES` to set number of cores. Set it to empty or 0 to override default 2.  In addition standard `$APPLICATION_OPTIONS` is honoured.

# AQA jcstress playlist generator and tester
The generator is slightly over-engineered but do its job quite well. It takes only one argument - the file to jcstress.jar. The name of file maters - it is used in the command.

**It is necessary that default usage of the generator always prints the playlist.xml as it shuold be**

Adjust the defaults in `Generate.java` if you change them. `javac Generate.java` and `java Generate.java <pathToJcstressJar> > playlist.xml` should do the job.

Except the generation the class can also print final standalone statistics or regexes for future research. It can also calculate estimated time of all groups by forking and killing jcstress jar (of course this feature is useless with `-tb`). It can also run all the jcstress groups, and calculate precise times. Current implementation looks like:
<details>
<summary>Setup</summary>
<pre>
Limit is 100; no group with more then 100 of tests should be merged to bigger ones. Exclude list is of length of 4
Small groups will not be created. Intentional?
Huge groups will NOT be split to more subsets. Intentional?
Max count of natural grouping iterations is 3
Only N from FQN will be used. This saves space, but risks duplicate matches
Cores limit for final playlist is not used
Time budget is not used. Intentional?
Output is set TEST
Total test cases: 11543
total tests files: 4374
Natural groups round 1 : 251
Natural groups round 2 : 112
Natural groups round 3 : 82

*Each runtime generator is run, it first **verify**, that **all** tests will be **run**, and that **each** will be run exactly **once**.* Also, in `test` mode (and of course in `do` mode) it verifies, that each group can be launched. Because the `|` expressions may grow very long, and under some circumstances may flow out of shell's boundaries.

## Control variables
In order of importance and reasonability
 * OUTPUT - one of  
   * do - will run all groups as jcstress (takes ages!).  If interrupted, will print at least what was calculated up to that time
   * test - will fork and kill `java jcstress.jar` and estimate time of all groups. If interrupted, will print at least what was calculated up to that time
   * stats - will print amount of tests in each group
   * regexes - will print just final regexes
   * validate - will validate given (instead of jar) playlist.xml
   * **generate - default, will print playlist.xml to stdout**
 * LIMIT - number. **default is 100**. Every group smaller then LIMIT will be merged to bigger subset.
 * SMALL_GROUPS - true/false. **default is false**. After natural grouping is done, all remaining groups smaller then LIMIT are merged to artificial groups
 * SPLIT_BIG_BASES - true/false. **default is false**. Each natural  group group bigger then LIMIT is split once it reaches limit.
 * MAX_NATURAL_ITERATIONS - number, usually 1-10, how many namespaces can be cut for natural grouping.
 * CORES - number, **defaults to 2**. Set to 0 to use all cores (recomeded by upstream, but runing surprsingly long)
 * TIME_BUDGET - string, **defaults to 1h**. set to anything you think your tests will fit. This is just best effort, not a strict cut. It is upstream bug. 0 i sunlimited.
 * VERBOSE - set to true to see a lot of weird stuff
 * FQN - set to true to use fully qualified names instead of shortened ones. This may casue soem targets to not fit to OS cmdline limit.

org.openjdk.jcstress.tests.atomicity.varHandles.fields.WeakCASTest:

Are not mixed, because MAX_NATURAL_ITERATIONS was 3. If it would be 4, one more level would be  cut (if LIMIT allows), to:
org.openjdk.jcstress.tests.atomicity.varHandles.arrays
org.openjdk.jcstress.tests.atomicity.varHandles.fields

If it would be 5, and LIMIT would allow, it would cut one more: to
org.openjdk.jcstress.tests.atomicity.varHandles

 * CORES - number, **null by default (thus all cores)**. Number of cores used to generate list and and run jcstress.
 * TIME_BUDGET - time budget, **null by default (thus no limit)**. Applies only to generated groups. The default target `all` have hardcoded value
 * FQN - **false by default**. If true, no prefix would be cut from tests in `|` expressions
 * SPLIT_ALL - **true by default**, if false, some hardcoded groups, which are known to have a lot of tests, but run surprisingly quickly are excluded from splitting if `SPLIT_BIG_BASES` is true.
 * VERBOSE - prints some debugging info. **false by default**. Enable byu setting to true.


 It is obvious, that the `Generate.java` can create pretty balanced groups by number of tests, but it proved to be not exactly useful, as single jcsrtress tests do not have constant duration. The `-tb` is usually not honoured, it is common to exceed it by 200% but also by 20000% - https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/CODETOOLS-7903750

 ### Algorithm:
  * the natural groups are finished first. They are created by grouping packages.
    * this runs in iterations, and by default breaks when iteration merges nothing
    * if `MAX_NATURAL_ITERATIONS` is enabled, then it stops merging after MAX_NATURAL_ITERATIONS of iterations.
    * each group with less then `LIMIT` of members is merged to another with shares namespace
    * if `SPLIT_BIG_BASES` is enabled, then each namespaces will be split so it do not exceed LIMIT.
  * if `SMALL_GROUPS` are enabled then all leftovers smaller then LIMIT are merged to unnatural groups at the end.
    * Again, once this artificial group reaches limit no more tests is added 

Before this playlist was created, many experiments were run:

 split_all Limit 10 - 603 groups, from those  7 "small groups" (0.5hours each. %like longest/ideal %68%/81 (26m-38m)
 split_exl Limit 50 - 128 groups, from those  6 "small groups" (~2.5hhours each. %like longest/ideal %60/85% (45m-3.5h)
 split_all Limit 50 - 206 groups, from those  7 "small groups" (~1.1 hours each. %like longest/ideal %37/27% (6s-3.5h)   
   (there was an error (eg for rg.openjdk.jcstress.tests.seqcst.sync-028) 3 actors:   No scheduling is possible, these tests would not run. Which I need to investiagte and maybe fall back to simple more simple class counting, or run also the -l listing with -c (which seems most correct, as -l is indeed counting with -c)
 the real min time would be some 1hour.
 split_exl Limit 100 - 60 groups, from those  7 "small groups" (~4.5hours each. %like longest/ideal %63/79% (2.5h-7h)
 split_all Limit 100 - 99 groups, from those  7 "small groups" (~2.5hours each . %like longest/ideal %38/21% (7s-7h)
   (same error, so real min time would be again some 2.5 hours)
 
  The estimated times are highly CORES sensitive. Some tests do not even run with CORES=1!
  Some groups, eg org.openjdk.jcstress.tests.seqcst.sync and org.openjdk.jcstress.tests.seqcst.volatiles are highly affected by cores (2->2hours 4=>45days!)
  other groups are slightly less affected by cores, but still are.
  
  This table was genrated with CORES=2 in TEST mode (thus with aprox 75% accuracy).
  jcstress20240202  4400classes with 11500 tests.
  Note, that `%like longest/ideal` is better closer to bigger/bigger.
  all: 2 cores and org.openjdk.jcstress.tests.seqcst.sync and org.openjdk.jcstress.tests.seqcst.volatiles not split:

  Limit 1000 - 9 groups, from those  5 "small groups" (~1day 6hours each. %like longest/ideal 42%/41% (2.5h-3d)
  Limit 2000 - 6 groups, from those  4 "small groups" (~2day each, %like longest/ideal 41%/9% (2.5h-4d)
  Limit 5000 - 3 groups, from those  3 "small groups" (unknown, selector argument to long for one of groups)
  Limit 50000 - 1 groups, from those 1 "small groups" (unknown, selector argument to long)
  all tests in batch ~11.5 of day
  The minimal 2.5 which is invalidating huge groups a bit, are  the two excluded gorg.openjdk.jcstress.tests.seqcst.sync and org.openjdk.jcstress.tests.seqcst.volatiles,
 
  Note, that LIMIT is not strictly honored. It is jsut saying, that if there LIMIT of testes or more, it wil not be grouped.
  So in worse scenario, LIMIT-1+LIMIT-1 will join to group of size of (2*LIMIT)-2, but it is very rare,
  and in addition the time of one test is very far from being constant, so this deviation in size of grtoup (LIMIT+1, <2*LIMIT)-2> is minimal.
  If small groups are enagetOutputSbled, and they should be, there wil nearly always be some leftover group with size <= LIMIT

So any regenerator, be warned, it seems it is impossible to group jcstress tests in really balanced way. In addition, it omitting any si a no go, all jcstress test are equally important.
